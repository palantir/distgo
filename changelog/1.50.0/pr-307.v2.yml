    Add support for multi-architecture builds with a docker `buildx` builder.
    This is not directly exposed to end users of `distgo`, and the default
    behavior is identical, but allows for plugins to start using this builder.

    The only supported output for multi-architecture builds is an OCI image
    layout, which is produced in a new dist directory.
