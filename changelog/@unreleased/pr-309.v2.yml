    Add support for publishing multi-architecture docker images as part of the
    "push" command if the corresponding OCI artifact exists. This behavior is
    gated on the existence of an OCI layout existing in the expected "dist"
    directory for the docker configuration we're pushing.
    
    If no OCI layout exists on disk, this change will have no affect to the
    previous push behavior.
