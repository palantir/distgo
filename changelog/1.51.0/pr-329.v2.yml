fix:
  description: Use buildx subcommand for docker daemon output builds. This fixes the
    docker daemon output type for dockerfiles which take advantage of various buildkit
    features, such as [platform args](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#automatic-platform-args-in-the-global-scope).
    The `buildx` subcommand is backwards compatible, so Dockerfiles which worked with
    previous versions of this plugin should continue building without issues.
